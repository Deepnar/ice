# Z1 — the experiment index

**⚑ READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING ANY Z1 EXPERIMENT.** It exists for one reason: to
stop a session re-running something already settled, or re-deriving a number
already recorded. Both have happened repeatedly — [TRAPS #42](../../docs/TRAPS.md)
is the entry for it, and it names two cases from a single afternoon.

**This file is an INDEX, not a record.** One line per thing, with a pointer.
Nothing is explained here; everything lives in its normal home:

| what | where it lives |
|---|---|
| what was run, with what numbers, and what it does NOT show | [`docs/PROVENANCE.md`](../../docs/PROVENANCE.md) |
| the queue, and what is blocked on what | [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../../docs/ROADMAP.md) |
| how a measurement lied, and how it was caught | [`docs/TRAPS.md`](../../docs/TRAPS.md) |
| which feature is on, off, or inert | [`docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`](../../docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md) |
| which model did which job, and what was tested | [`docs/MODELS.md`](../../docs/MODELS.md) §5 |

⚠ **Z1 ONLY.** Z2 (the whole-system / answer-level test) gets its own index when
it starts. Do not mix them.

## 1. SETTLED — do not re-run these

| question | answer | where |
|---|---|---|
| Does a bigger background model fix extraction? | **No.** 8 models 4B→26B, defects in all 7 viable arms ⇒ prompt/design, not capacity | PROVENANCE `A12` (2026-08-12) |
| Does NuNER beat micro-NER for codex grounding? | **Form, not outcome.** malformed 25.0→12.5%, non-entity nodes 58.7→40.7%; correctness 18→20% (inside 1 SE) | PROVENANCE 2026-08-20 |
| Is `extraction_confidence` a usable truth signal? | **No — it is INVERTED.** grounded 0.9 = 2.5% correct, rejected 0.35 = 18.1%. Reproduced in both arms | PROVENANCE 2026-08-20, 2026-08-22 |
| Do the six write-path mechanism fixes make the graph more TRUE? | **No — a null.** Every mechanism moved; correctness did not (z ≤ 1.14) | PROVENANCE 2026-08-22 |
| Are reversals created by relation canonicalisation? | **No.** Blocking 1,611 direction/polarity merges left the reversal rate flat ⇒ generated, not merged | PROVENANCE 2026-08-22 |
| Can a closed 197-word relation vocabulary work? | **No.** 67.8% of real relations are out-of-vocabulary; the repair ladder recovers 5.7% | PROVENANCE 2026-08-03/04 |
| Is the procedural leg's 1.000 a real score? | **No — a tautology.** It returns its limit (5 fragments) on every query, nonsense included | TRAPS #37 |

## 2. OPEN — the live queue

| question | blocked on | where |
|---|---|---|
| **Does the direction rule cut reversals?** +9.4 pts seen, but two same-config runs spanned 10.0–20.4% | judge sampling (below) | ROADMAP `G59` |
| **Can two identical seeds reproduce each other?** | running 2026-08-23 | `check_reproducible.sh` |
| Which small background model is best? | the two above | MODELS.md §5 |
| NuNER vs micro on FIXED code | maintainer: **stay on NuNER for now** | — |
| Retrieval numbers under the corrected metric | re-score pending | ROADMAP `G52` |
| Should the 44% of non-lossless turns feed the graph? | **maintainer decided YES** — needs implementing | ROADMAP `G57` |
| `extraction_confidence` must stop being a truth prior | not started | ROADMAP `G58`-adjacent, PROVENANCE 2026-08-22 |

## 3. ⚑ THE MEASUREMENT FLOOR — read before quoting any number

- **Judge self-consistency: ±2.5 pts.** Same judge, same store, same seed, same
  200 triplets, run twice → 87.1% identical verdicts.
- **⚑ Sampling: ±8 pts.** 200 triplets come from only ~76 turns and triplets in
  a turn are correlated, so the independent unit is the TURN. Two runs of the
  same configuration on content-identical stores gave **20.4%** and **10.0%**.
- ⇒ **Every graph-quality number this project has published (20%, 15.8%, 11.0%,
  20.4%, 10.0%) is one measurement with a ±8 pt interval.** None are
  distinguishable from each other.
- **Fix shipped 2026-08-23:** `judge_codex.py --per-turn K` samples every turn;
  `report_power()` prints the interval and refuses to let a bare percentage
  stand alone. ⚠ Its benefit is **unverified on a full store** — re-check.

## 4. SCRIPTS — what each one is for

**Seeding / arms**
| script | purpose |
|---|---|
| `seed_store.py` | build a store from the corpus (`--clean`, `--limit`, `--bg-model`) |
| `ner_arm_seed.sh` | the A9b two-arm NER comparison (micro vs NuNER) |
| `two_arm_seed.sh` | earlier two-arm background-model seed |
| `reseed_postfix.sh` | one arm, arm-B config, varying ONLY the code |
| `prompt_ab_noisefloor.sh` | 4 arms: each prompt twice → effect + noise floor |
| `check_reproducible.sh` | **detector**: same seed twice, compare. No fix in it, deliberately |
| `snapshot.py` | `save` / `restore` / `list` / `counts` an arm |
| `drain_batch_summaries.py` | force + ASSERT batch summaries (a swallowed failure once cost 3 days) |

**Probes / ground truth**
| script | purpose |
|---|---|
| `generate_typed_probes.py` | build the typed probe set |
| `generate_probes.py` | the older flat probe set |
| `derive_retrieval_gt.py` | ground truth for retrieval |
| `verify_gold.py` / `check_gold_consistency.py` | validate the gold before trusting a score |

**Scoring / judging**
| script | purpose |
|---|---|
| `score_typed.py` | 5 per-type metrics. **Never averaged into one number** |
| `score_retrieval.py` | recall@k / MRR on the flat probe set |
| `answer_probes.py` | retrieve → assemble the REAL prompt → generate an answer |
| `judge_answers.py` | paired A/B verdicts on answers |
| `judge_codex.py` | **is the stored graph TRUE?** the only outcome metric here |
| `compare_judgements.py` | two judgement runs, per TRIPLET not per rate |
| `dump_graph_fingerprint.py` | compare two stores triplet-by-triplet; localises divergence |
| `harvest_probe_context.py` | reading instrument, computes no score |
| `run_leg_ablations.sh` | the five per-leg ablations |
| `store_report.py` | store statistics |
| `production_parity.py` | **the ONE reproduction of `main.py`'s pre-retrieval path** |
| `run_meta.py` | provenance block stamped into every artifact |

## 5. ARTIFACTS — where output lands

⚠ **All of `experiments/curation_files/` is GITIGNORED** (it carries the
corpus). A number that matters must be copied into PROVENANCE in the same
session — [TRAPS #40](../../docs/TRAPS.md).

| path | holds |
|---|---|
| `snapshots/<arm>.sql` + `.counts` | a full store, restorable |
| `score_runs/*.json` | typed / retrieval scores. ⚠ some are stamped `INVALIDATED` — read `meta` |
| `judgements/codex_quality_*.json` | per-triplet graph-truth verdicts |
| `probe_answers/*.json` | assembled prompts + generated answers |
| `fingerprints/*.json` | graph fingerprints for reproducibility checks |
| `typed_probes.json` | **the live probe set** (444). Others are older generations |
| `logs/` (repo root) | run logs. Gitignored but survive reboot — never write to `/tmp` |

## 6. ARMS — which store is which

| snapshot | NER | code | prompt | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ner-a-micro` | micro | pre-08-22 | old | A9b arm A |
| `ner-b-nuner` | NuNER | pre-08-22 | old | **A9b arm B — the baseline most numbers cite** |
| `ner-b-postfix` | NuNER | 08-22 fixes | old | the six write-path fixes, 293 turns |
| `dir-false-run1/2` | NuNER | 08-22 | old | direction-rule control, 180 turns |
| `dir-true-run1/2` | NuNER | 08-22 | **new** | direction rule ON |
| `fixed-*`, `gemma4-26b`, `pre-*`, `arm1-post-g50` | — | older | — | superseded; kept for history |

## 7. RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE

1. **Check section 1 before proposing an experiment.** Grep PROVENANCE for the
   *subject*, not the item id you have in mind.
2. **Quote the interval, never the bare percentage.** §3 is why.
3. **One variable per arm.** Two changes and one number answers neither.
4. **Same judge, same seed, or the comparison is not a comparison.**
5. **A number that matters goes into PROVENANCE the same session.** The folder
   it was written to is gitignored.
6. **Update this file when an experiment lands.** One line. If it takes more
   than a line it belongs in PROVENANCE and this gets the pointer.
